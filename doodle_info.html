        War of the Worlds (1938)
    </a>
    <div class="text">
        In 1898, H.G. Wells published <i>The War of the Worlds</i>.  40 years later, the novel was
        adapted as a Halloween episode of the drama series <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i> on 
        CBS radio, directed and narrated by Orson Welles.  The <i>Mercury Theatre</i> writers changed 
        the setting of the episode from locations in Europe to towns and cities on the east coast of 
        the United States, but the original plot of an attack on Earth by an army from Mars remained 
        the same.  It is said to have caused mass panic across the country.

        The episode begins as a casual music broadcast.  However, after news of explosions on
        Mars and a meteorite landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey, the music is cut short and a
        reporter goes to investigate.  The meteorite is revealed to be a spaceship, and Martians 
        emerge, using a heat ray to kill police and onlookers as well as set a nearby forest ablaze.
        Bulletins come in from up and down the mid-Atlantic states about similar sightings, and are
        read by the announcer in between eyewitness accounts and speeches by various military and 
        government officials concerning the attacks.  Earthly weapons seem to hardly do damage to 
        the giant Martian machines.  The frenzy culminates with another reporter broadcasting from 
        the top of a studio in Manhattan as the Martians storm the city and release a cloud of poison 
        gas.  He narrates the gas's approach, coughs, and then seemingly collapses, dead.

        At the end of the show, Welles goes out of character to state that it is fiction.  "That was 
        no Martian," he says, "it's Halloween."  The broadcast also begins by announcing the 
        <i>Mercury Theatre</i> and their rendition of Wells's novel.  However, the listeners 
        that tuned in for the middle of the show (during breaks in other, more popular shows on at 
        the same time) took it as fact.  The alarm was significant enough to send policemen to the 
        radio studio to stop the broadcast, and a struggle ensued as CBS employees attempted to stop 
        the police from breaking into the recording booth.  News reporters, photographers, and more 
        police were outside the building, so once they were off the air, the cast left through the 
        building's back door.

        Despite the thousands of news artibles written about the broadcast and resulting panic, many 
        speculate that its effect was not as widespread as the headlines made it seem.  Regardless, 
        it demonstrated the effect radio could have on people.  For more information,
