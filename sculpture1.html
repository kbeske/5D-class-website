            The scissors are very large.  The scissors’ handles are above the ground, 
            as is one of the blades, reaching about 5 feet tall at its highest point. 
            The other blade is embedded into the ground as if it’s cutting through 
            the road at the crosswalk.  I want it to look like the scissors are cutting 
            the last strip off of a white paper or something so it can be glued onto 
            the road to construct the crosswalk.  To cross the crosswalk, people will 
            either have to walk around the scissors or duck under the top blade.

            One way the sculpture would alter the viewer’s idea of scissors is by 
            showing the viewer what will probably be the biggest pair of scissors 
            they’ve ever seen.  It seems like scissors are seen as a small generic 
            tool.  Even ceremonial scissors aren’t that big.  By using a pair of 
            scissors so large, this sculpture will highlight details of scissors 
            that viewers may notice for the first time.

            The sculpture would also challenge commonly held ideas of how scissors 
            are used, since no one would think to use scissors to cut rocks, let alone 
            asphalt or road paint.  On the other side, the sculpture would provide 
            an interesting alternate take on crosswalks.  Crosswalks are paint on 
            asphalt and it’s pretty easy for a viewer to see that, but the sculpture 
            will make it seem like white strips are being cut and laid out to form 
            a crosswalk on the road.
