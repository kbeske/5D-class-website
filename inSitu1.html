          <div class="info-text">
            There are two holes, a smaller rounder one and a larger oblong one, 
            that afford holding by putting your thumb through the smaller hole and 
            fingers through the larger.  The blades afford cutting because they 
            are sharp.  There is a non-sharp side covered in plastic that affords 
            that the part a person touches should be there (rather than the blades).  
            The pivot/hinge affords that the blades must be opened and shut to cut 
            things, and that the side with the holes should move to force the blades 
            to move.  In my scissors’ case, the shape of the handle affords right 
            handed cutting.  The scissors can still be held in the left hand, just 
            less comfortably.

            Historical:
          </div>
          <div class="info-text">
            Blades preceded scissors, but scissors aren’t a young invention.  Spring-type 
            scissors (two blades connected with a C shaped piece of metal) originated 
            in the Bronze Age.  Many regions used them including the Middle East, 
            Europe, and East Asia.  Scissors evolved to use an open/close hand motion 
            rather than a squeeze, although spring-types do still exist.  In the 19th 
            century, many scissors were handmade with ornate details, but this was 
            later simplified so that scissors could be mass produced.

            Constraints:
          </div>
          <div class="info-text">
            Scissors can’t cut large stacks of paper or thick objects.  For that, 
            a single larger blade is needed at the expense of safety.  For my scissors 
            specifically, the object being cut can’t be flush against another surface 
            because opening your hand to get ready to cut would force you to bump 
            the handle on that surface.  Surgical scissors with the blades at an 
            angle are an example of scissors without this constraint.  My scissors 
            were also made with preference for right handed cutting, which is a 
            slight constraint for left handed people.  No environmental elements 
            are necessary to use scissors, but depending on the metal used it might 
            be better to keep them dry or else they might rust.

            Cultural Constraints:
          </div>
          <div class="info-text">
            Scissors have had a very interesting effect on culture.  “Scissor” has 
            become a verb meaning a specific way of moving one’s legs.  Rock Paper 
            Scissors is a game most people know, with what many view as scissors’ 
            main function, cutting paper, coming into play.  There are also many 
            superstitions surrounding scissors.  For example, opening and closing 
            scissors at a wedding in some African cultures can make the groom unable 
            to consummate the marriage.  Many cultures think dropping a pair of 
            scissors will bring bad luck, especially if they land upright with both 
            points embedded into the floor.  Other superstitions state that scissors 
            can be used as protection from evil spirits.
